Important Notes
===============

Read this, or aSmack won't work for you!

Static Code
-----------

In order to work correctly on Android, you need to register Smack's
XMPP Providers and Extensions manually and init some static code
blocks before you doing any XMPP activty. Calling
SmackAndroid.init(Context) (in org.jivesoftware.smack) will do this
for you.

ConnectionConfiguration
-----------------------

Please use the provided AndroidConnectionConfiguration class if
possible to create a new connection.

How to debug your problem

IDE. Enable debugging mode with [BOSH|XMPP]Connection.DEBUG and
config.setDebug. See also:

Reporting a bug
---------------

Your issue should contain
1. a logcat
2. a server to reproduce
3. the code you are using (for FOSS project we'll accept reposituroy URLs)

If you record a logcat and make sure to remove your credentials
(usually a base64 block inside <auth></auth>).

There is no guarantee that we will reply immediatly. But we will try
to investigate the problem. Feel free to join ##smack @ freenode and
